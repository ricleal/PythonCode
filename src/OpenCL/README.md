# demo
Simplest example: Executes a multiplication in the GPU of 2 numpy random vectors.

# dot_product
Product of 4x4 matrix by 1X4 vector using *dot* product function from OpenCL library

# benchmark
Prints output of the graphics card


# gaussianDispersion
This does not use OpenCL. A test to plot gaussian dispersion. It is also used by the cylinder.py

# run
Run's the cylinder SAS Model in the GPU
Uses *cylinder.cpp and py* and *gaussianDispersion*
